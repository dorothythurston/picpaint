#PicPaint
A sketching/drawing app that lets users choose photos from their photoroll, draw colorfully on them, and then send their creations to their friends through email or via text.

Things I worked on while making this app:
- Using UIImagePickerController and UIAlertController
- Drawing on screens
- Passing values and using segues
- Implementing basic UI elements such as sliders and UIViews
